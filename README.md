Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice

Wrong:

Bob: Did not do a git pull origin master.
Alice: Did not do git pull origin master on her laptop.
Carol: Did not do a git pull origin master. Worked in the master.
Ted: Worked in the master.



Writing more code without pulling from origin on all laptops.
Never code in the master branch. Always create new branch
Should always pull before editing.
