"What time did the man go to the dentist? Tooth hurt-y."


I went to the funeral of a friend recently who had drowned. We were going to get him a floral wreath, but instead we decided on a life raft. It's what he would have wanted.

An elephant walks into a pub and says "Large scotch please barman."
"You again" says the bar man "Why do you drink so much?"

The elephant replies "I do it to forget."

"A ham sandwich walks into a bar and orders a beer. Bartender says, 'Sorry we don't serve food here.'"

"Why did the Clydesdale give the pony a glass of water? â€¨Because he was a little horse!"

"How do you make a Kleenex dance? Put a little boogie in it!"

What did the fish say when it ran into a wall?

Dam.
