"What time did the man go to the dentist? Tooth hurt-y."

An elephant walks into a pub and says "Large scotch please barman."
"You again" says the bar man "Why do you drink so much?"

The elephant replies "I do it to forget."

"A ham sandwich walks into a bar and orders a beer. Bartender says, 'Sorry we don't serve food here.'"
